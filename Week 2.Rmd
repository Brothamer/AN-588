## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Matrices
Matrices are collections of vectors
```{r MAtrices by column}
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) #Creating a matrix that fills column-wise
m
```
```{r MAtrices by  row}
n <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) #Creating a matrix that fills row-wise
n
```
```{r MAtrices by binding vectors}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2) #builds row-wise
m1

m2 <- cbind(v1, v2) #builds column-wise
m2
```

###Metadata about a matrix

```{r MAtrices metadata}
class(m1) #object class
dim(m1) #matrix dimensions
colnames(m1) #report column names (not defined for this matrix: NULL)
rownames(m1) #report row names
(str(m1)) #provides details about any data structure
```
##Arrays
Vectors and matrices are both types of arrays. They can have any number of dimensions but all the elements must be the same class.
```{r Arrays}
a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3)) #creating a 3 dimensional array that is 5x6x3
a
```
