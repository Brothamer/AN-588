## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Matrices
Matrices are collections of vectors
```{r MAtrices by column}
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) #Creating a matrix that fills column-wise
m
```
```{r MAtrices by  row}
n <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) #Creating a matrix that fills row-wise
n
```
```{r MAtrices by binding vectors}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2) #builds row-wise
m1

m2 <- cbind(v1, v2) #builds column-wise
m2
```

###Metadata about a matrix

```{r MAtrices metadata}
class(m1) #object class
dim(m1) #matrix dimensions
colnames(m1) #report column names (not defined for this matrix: NULL)
rownames(m1) #report row names
(str(m1)) #provides details about any data structure
```
##Arrays
Vectors and matrices are both types of arrays. They can have any number of dimensions but all the elements must be the same class.
```{r Arrays}
a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3)) #creating a 3 dimensional array that is 5x6x3
a
```
##Subsetting / Indexing
Selecting elements from vectors, matrices, and arrays using their index positions in bracket notation
```{r Arrays}
v <- 1:100  #This creates a vector containing all integers from 1 to 100 to use as an example
v

v[1:15] #select the first 15 elements

v[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)] #select a vector of specific elements

v[seq(from = 1, to = 15, by = 2)] #using a function/calculation to subset a vector
```
##Challenge 1

Creating a vector of the first sentence of *Ulysses* by James Joyce.
```{r Challenge 1 vector}
Ulysses <- c("Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.") #creating the string
Ulysses
Ulysses_unpunct <- gsub("[[:punct:]]","",Ulysses) #removing punctuation
Ulysses_unpunct
Ulysses_split <- str_split_1(Ulysses_unpunct, " ") #dividing the string into a vector of substrings
Ulysses_split
```
Extacting every third element of the vector
```{r Challenge 1 subset}
every3 <- Ulysses_split[seq(from = 3, to = 21, by = 3)]
every3
```

##Challenge 2
```{r Challenge 2 matrix}
mat <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE) #creating the matrix
mat
```
Given the matrix, mat, above, extract the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns and assign them to the variable x
```{r Challenge 2 extract}
x <- mat[c(2,3,6), ]
x
```
Given the matrix, mat, above, extract the 6th to 8th row and assign them to the variable y
```{r Challenge 2 extract}
y <- mat[c(6,8), ]
y
```
Given the matrix, mat, above, extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable z
```{r Challenge 2 extract}
z <- c(mat[2,2], mat[6,9])
z
```
