## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Matrices
Matrices are collections of vectors
```{r MAtrices by column}
m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) #Creating a matrix that fills column-wise
m
```
```{r MAtrices by  row}
n <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) #Creating a matrix that fills row-wise
n
```
```{r MAtrices by binding vectors}
v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2) #builds row-wise
m1

m2 <- cbind(v1, v2) #builds column-wise
m2
```

###Metadata about a matrix

```{r MAtrices metadata}
class(m1) #object class
dim(m1) #matrix dimensions
colnames(m1) #report column names (not defined for this matrix: NULL)
rownames(m1) #report row names
(str(m1)) #provides details about any data structure
```
##Arrays
Vectors and matrices are both types of arrays. They can have any number of dimensions but all the elements must be the same class.
```{r Arrays}
a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3)) #creating a 3 dimensional array that is 5x6x3
a
```
##Subsetting / Indexing
Selecting elements from vectors, matrices, and arrays using their index positions in bracket notation
```{r Arrays}
v <- 1:100  #This creates a vector containing all integers from 1 to 100 to use as an example
v

v[1:15] #select the first 15 elements

v[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)] #select a vector of specific elements

v[seq(from = 1, to = 15, by = 2)] #using a function/calculation to subset a vector
```
##Challenge 1

Creating a vector of the first sentence of *Ulysses* by James Joyce.
```{r Challenge 1 vector}
Ulysses <- c("Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.") #creating the string
Ulysses
Ulysses_unpunct <- gsub("[[:punct:]]","",Ulysses) #removing punctuation
Ulysses_unpunct
Ulysses_split <- str_split_1(Ulysses_unpunct, " ") #dividing the string into a vector of substrings
Ulysses_split
```
Extacting every third element of the vector
```{r Challenge 1 subset}
every3 <- Ulysses_split[seq(from = 3, to = 21, by = 3)]
every3
```

##Challenge 2
```{r Challenge 2 matrix}
mat <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE) #creating the matrix
mat
```
Given the matrix, mat, above, extract the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns and assign them to the variable x
```{r Challenge 2 extract}
x <- mat[c(2,3,6), ]
x
```
Given the matrix, mat, above, extract the 6th to 8th row and assign them to the variable y
```{r Challenge 2 extract}
y <- mat[c(6,8), ]
y
```
Given the matrix, mat, above, extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable z
```{r Challenge 2 extract}
z <- c(mat[2,2], mat[6,9])
z
```

##Challenge 3
Construct a 4-dimensional, 400 element array (5 x 5 x 4 x 4) named a consisting of the numbers 400 to 1 (i.e., a descending series)
```{r Challenge 3 4D array}
a <- array(data = 1:400, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a
```
Given this matrix, what would the following return?

a[1, 1, 1, 2]

a[2, 3, 2, ]

a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
```{r Challenge 3 return values}
a[1,1,1,2] #a single point
a[2,3,2,] #a vector
a[1:5,1:5,3,3] #a matrix
```
##Overwriting
You can replace elements in a vector or matrix, or even entire rows or columns, by identifying the elements to be replaced and then assigning them new values

Starting with the matrix, mat, defined above, what will be the effects of operations below? 

```{r Overwriting a matrix}
mat[7, 1] <- 564 #replaces one point
mat[, 8] <- 2 #replaces a collumn
mat[2:5, 4:8] <- 1 #replaces a 4x5 area
mat[2:5, 4:8] <- c(20, 19, 18, 17) #replaces a 4x5 area with specific repeating values column-wise
mat[2:5, 4:8] <- matrix(data = c(20:1), nrow = 4, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE) #replaces a 4x5 area with specific descending values row-wise
mat[, 8] <- c("a", "b") #replaces column 8 with characters "a" and "b" alternating; turns the numeric matrix into a character matric

mat
```
##Lists and Data Frames
Lists and data frames can be used together to group mixed structures and objects.
Lists are created using list()
```{r Lists}
s <- c("this", "is", "a", "vector", "of", "strings")  # here we have a vector
m <- matrix(data = 1:40, nrow = 5, ncol = 8)  # this is a matrix
b <- FALSE  #and this is a logical statement
l <- list(s, m, b)  # this puts them all together as a list
l
```
To extract elements from a list, use double brackets.
```{r List extracting}
l[[2]] #this will pull out element 2 which is the matrix
```
```{r List indexing 2}
l[[2]][2,6] #this will pull out position [2,6] from element 2 of the list
```
To reference/extract multiple elements from a list, you would use single bracket notation, which would itself return a list. This is called “list slicing”.
```{r List slicing}
l[1:2]  # This is taking just elements 1 and 2 from the list
```
Using str() provides details about the elements in a list:
```{r List details}
str(l)
```
Elements in lists can be named with names()
```{r List element names}
names(l) <- c("string", "matrix", "logical")
names(l)
```
Now, you can use the name of an item in the list to refer to it:
```{r List element names}
l$string  
l$matrix[3, 5]  
```
